    Hi, I'm Swapnesh, I design games, play and learning experiences. I work as an independent game designer and researcher, with studios, startups and in collaboration with other designers, artists, researchers, and developers.<br><br>

    
    
    Currently, I'm working with <a target="blank" href="https://www.clubgrok.com">Grok!</a> building 21st century skills for kids using games.
