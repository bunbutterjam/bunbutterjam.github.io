    Hi, I'm Swapnesh, I design games, playful Interactions and do design research. I occasionally also try to <a
        href=""></a> <a href="writing.html" target="_blank">write</a> my views and
    experiences on
    games, play, art, design and technology.<br><br>

    I mostly work independent in varied capacity with studios, clients and in collaboration with
    other designers, artists,
    researchers, and developers. My current area of interest is in exploring games as a form of non-linguistic
    communication, to
    explore, express and learn complex ideas in abstract and creative ways. My other interests are in the areas of Aesthetics of Play,
    Transformative Play, Learning and Games, History and Culture of Games, Generative Design and
    Design Education. <br><br>

    I like listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music" target="_blank" >Hindustani Classical</a>,
    Folk, and Jazz music. I like reading children books, specially those written by children or without words, love flipping
    pages a lot. Prefer bike
    over car, individuals over groups and salty over sweet.
    I support coexistence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism" target="_blank">absurdism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">free as in freedom</a> and <a
