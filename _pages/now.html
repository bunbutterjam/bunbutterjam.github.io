I'm trying to work on a couple of things that I'd planned to finish my the end of this year which seems very unlikely. I will keep updating this page as my interest, projects, and life changes.<br><br>

<ul>

    <li>A tabletop game about growing flowers, working title 'Guldasta'. Check out the design log here at <a href="https://lonelynightproject.tumblr.com/">lonely night project.</a></li><br>
    <li>Working on a commissioned project to research and design a living games museum based on a personal collection of traditional games.</li><br>
    <li>Exploring my old interest in toy making again. Hopefully some updates coming soon.</li><br>
    <li>Learning <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5js</a>, though not very regular, but trying to make at least one sketch every weekend. Also, got a new wacom so trying out some digital drawing techniques, checkout my <a href="https://bunbutterjam.tumblr.com/">visual blog.</a></li><br>
    <li>Reading <i>The Search - Talks on the Ten Bulls of Zen</i> by Osho </li><br>
</ul><br>
