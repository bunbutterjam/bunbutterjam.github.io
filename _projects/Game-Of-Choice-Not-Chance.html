<p>
    Game of Choice, not Chance, is a USAID-funded pilot program in India for urban and peri-urban adolescent girls between the age of 15-19 to provide sexual and reprodcutive health knowledge through a narrative based video game based on real life scenarios. In the game players chooses to play as a character which best represent their own physical, demographic and psychographic manifestations and make choices for the character. This allowes players to be an active agent within the safe virtual environment, acquire knowledge, and negotioate on different topics with different non playing characters (NPCs) as they navigate through the characters journey, make choices and see the simulated outcomes of their choices.

    This is a multi organizational collaboration project between different agencies for research, design, art and tech. I worked as a Game Designer with <b><a href="https://www.vihara.asia/">Vihara Innovation Network</a></b> who is the creative and design incharge of the project. My work in the project was to design tools for the reseach, plan and conduct field research with other reseachers, ideation and brainstorming with the team, concept creation and contributing game design perspectives to the project.
