    Hi, I'm Swapnesh, I design games, play and learning experiences. <br><br>

    I work as an independent designer and researcher, with studios, startups and in collaboration with
    other designers, artists, researchers, and developers. I'm also a hobbyist toy maker and interested in creating tools and processes for children to tinker, create and express playfully. <br><br>
    
    Currently, I'm working with <a target="blank" href="https://www.clubgrok.com">Grok!</a> helping build games for children that impart 21st century skills. Previously I've worked as a design consultant with <a target="blank"  href="https://www.crejo.fun">Crejo</a>, <a target="blank"  href="https://byjus.com">BYJU's</a>, <a target="blank"  href="https://brightchamps.com">Bright Champ</a>, <a target="blank"  href="https://www.vihara.asia">Vihara</a>, <a target="blank"  href="https://www.nid.edu/home">NID</a>, and other organizations in the area of game design, research, gamification, and playful learning. I also help and conduct workshops for teachers, children and homeschoolers in developing playful learning tools and materials. 

    <br><br>
    My current area of interest is in exploring games and play as a form of non-linguistic communication, to explore, express, and learn non-linear ideas/systems in an abstract and creative ways. My other interests are in the areas of aesthetics of play, play and learning, non-representational games, serious games, art games, ludic heritage, meaningful gamification, comparative media studies, craft research and documentation, generative design and design education. <br><br>

    
    I enjoy listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music" target="_blank" >Hindustani Classical</a>,
    Folk, and Jazz music. I like reading children books, specially those written by children, love flipping
    pages a lot. <a target="blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ã‰ric_Rohmer">Eric Rohmer</a> is my current favorite director. 
    I support <a target="blank"  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism" target="_blank">absurdism</a>, coexistence, <a target="blank"  href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/designing-for-tinkerability.pdf">designing for tinkerability</a>, and <a href="https://www.ludozofi.com/home/library/grasshopper/" target="_blank">the grasshopper</a>.<br><br><br>
