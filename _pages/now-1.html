 <b>Living</b><br><br>
  I finally can and have started to travel after being at home for a long time. This time, I'm travelling the way I always wanted to, staying at one place for a considerable amount of time, and then moving to the next place and so on. I left home two months back in July to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shillong">Shillong, Meghalaya</a> where I stayed for sometime, and now I'm at by brother's place in Pilani for sometime. In the coming weeks, I'm planning to go to Himachal. I'm preparing a toy making workshop for children at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/sambhaavnaa.org/clc2/">Udaan Learning Center</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palampur,_Himachal_Pradesh">Palampur</a>. The workshop is currently planned for one week, but I might stay longer depend on if I get a chance to learn and explore other possibilities with the children and the community there. From Palampur, I'll be going to a small village Gushaini near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Himalayan_National_Park">Himalayan National Park</a> where I'm hoping to stay for sometime, though I'm little skeptical about the internet coverage in the area, as the place I'll be staying is in the interiors of the village, I hope I get at least a few hours of internet everyday, as I'll be continuing my work from there.

<b>Work</b><br>


<ol type="1">
  <li>&#x2022 Working as a Game Design Consultant for an EdTech startup <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.crejo.fun">Crejo.fun</a>, to create an online learning platform that offers extracurricular
    activities for holistic development of children. The first phase of the project that involves designing the Playful Interactions and Gamification of the platform is now almost coming to an end, we have designed the strategies and constructs, some part of the UI is also ready, I guess a part of it should roll out by the end of this month and a v0 with other features will be live in the coming weeks. Currently, I'm working with the curriculum team to design new learning games that are based on the course content and would help children to learn and practice the subjects along with the teachings.

  <li>&#x2022 Working on two other projects as a Design Consultant, one with a Stealth Startup working in the area of mental health and holistic wellbeing, and the other project is with <a href="https://www.lecodegames.com/home/">LECODE GAMES</a>, where I'm helping them with the overall design strategy, UX design and game design for different products they are trying to develop.</li><br>

  <li>&#x2022 Working on my new tabletop game - Guldasta <i>(working title)</i>, inspired by a Indian ritual of offering flowers to the gods in the temple to get their blessings. This project started as a part of <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/tabletop-mentorship-program">The Tabletop Mentorship Program</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/8935/jeffrey-d-allers">Jeff</a> but as always I was hesitant to grow the design and haven't tested the game much, hence the progress is very slow. The latest iteration is up for playtesting on TTS that I last tested time with Jeff before sending it for the <a href="https://theboardgameworkshop.com"> Board Game Design Contest</a>. In the contest, the game couldn't even across round one <i>(as expected)</i>, but because of it, we at least managed to make a short <a href="https://youtu.be/JKK5qhAoc8Y">video of the gameplay</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aY57ZWu3fpvyOpyE_AUpKWfnmyOK37GC/view?usp=sharing">sell sheet</a>. The game received some constructive feedback and offers of help with the playtesting by the judges which was motivating in some way. I'm continuing to work on the game in my free time,, and hopefully will start to test it virtually with other peers from the online game community. I'd planned to keep a design log for this project at <a target="_blank" href="https://lonelynightproject.tumblr.com/">lonely night project.</a> but I've been a little lazy <i>(in fact a lot)</i> in keeping up with the weekly progress. Hopefully I will soon at least document the iterations.
