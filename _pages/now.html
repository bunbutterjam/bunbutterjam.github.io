I'm living in my hometown with parents, working on a couple of things, and learning new games. <br><br>

<ul>
    <li>&#x2022 Working on a tabletop game about growing flowers with <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/8935/jeffrey-d-allers">Jeff</a>. Design log at <a href="https://lonelynightproject.tumblr.com/">lonely night project.</a> </li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Working on a commissioned project as a game researcher for a living games museum based on a personal collection of traditional games.</li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Exploring my old interest in toy making again. Hopefully some updates coming soon.</li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Learning <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5js</a>, not very regular, but trying to make some progress during the weekends. </li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Exploring digital drawing techniques in <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a> which sometimes I also post on my <a href="https://bunbutterjam.tumblr.com/">visual blog.</a> </li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Reading <i>"The Search - Talks on the Ten Bulls of Zen"</i> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajneesh">Osho.</a></li><br><br>
  </ul>
