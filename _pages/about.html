    Hi, I'm Swapnesh, I design games, play and learning experiences. <br><br>

    I work as an independent designer and researcher, with studios, startups and in collaboration with
    other designers, artists, researchers, and developers. I'm also a hobbyist toy maker and interested in creating tools and processes for children to tinker, create and express playfully. <br><br>
    
    My current area of interest is in exploring games and play as a form of non-linguistic communication, to explore, express, research and learn non-linear ideas/systems in an abstract and creative ways. My other interests are in the areas of Aesthetics of Play, Play and Learning, Non-representational Games, Serious Games, Art Games, Ludic Heritage, Meaningful Gamification, Design for tinkerability, Self Learning, Comparative Media Studies, Craft Research and Documentation, Generative Design and Design Education. <br><br>

    I enjoy listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music" target="_blank" >Hindustani Classical</a>,
    Folk, and Jazz music. I like reading children books, specially those written by children, love flipping
    pages a lot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ã‰ric_Rohmer">Eric Rohmer</a> is my current favorite director. 
    I support coexistence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism" target="_blank">absurdism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">free as in freedom</a> and <a
