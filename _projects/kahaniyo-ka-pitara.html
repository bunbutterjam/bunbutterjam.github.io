<p>
    Kahaniyo ka pitara is a magical box of stories which works in two modes, listening and recording. You can either listen to a curated collection of stories categorized according to the genre and are played on fixed channels which you can tune in by rotating the knob, or you can switch to the recording mode where you can record your own stories, and push it to the collection which later is mixed with other stories and randomly served to other listeners who are tuned in online from a different place on their own box. The name is inspired from a radio show 'Pitara', meaning a box full of surprises. <br><br>

    The idea is to create a slow and meaningful story telling and sharing experience by crafting a playful interaction
    which reinforces the idea of being receptive, listening and to evoke an aesthetic of wait. Contrary to the idea of
    how smart objects and media interactions are designed today, filled with enormous amount of information of all
    sorts, multi-functional and demanding micro-interactions, it tries to make the user more focused, delicate and more importantly not to go very mechanical with it. <br><br>


    <b>Concept</b> <br>

    The Pitara is designed in such a way, that if you interact with it too much, it stops functioning and start playing
    a noise until you tune it properly. There is a little play between the tuning of different channels; at any given
    time there are options of listing to maximum of seven stories and one recording, as you open the box/start it, a
    fair chance of listening to all the seven stories of different genre is given, which you can tune in one by one and
    listen from the beginning, before deciding on which one you want to listen to. There is a time threshold in which
    you can decide which story you want to listen today, and once you cross the time, you either only get to listen to
    the current story you are on or you get all the stories in between hence losing on bits of stories which you can
    fill up with your own imagination. Although, If you finish any one story from start to finish, you get a chance to
    listen to all the stories from start to finish on all the seven channels and also to push one of your own story to
    the collection, which later others can will get a chance to listen and enjoy.

    <i>some other variations of the same concept in different forms </i>

    <br> <br>

    
    The project is an exploration in the re-mediation of stories, and playful interaction to creates an aesthetic of
    wait, where the act of listening takes the listener into silence and teller into the joy of expression. Through this
    project I try to understand the playful behavior of technology, and if subtle forms of play be created with
    mechanics very different from those generally seen in action packed video games, and other playful media.
