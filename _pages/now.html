<p>
    I'm living with my parents in my hometown. I rarely step out of my house, sometimes my room. My schedule changes everyday and shift by two to four hours, yesterday I slept at 5am and today it's already 6am, so I will go to sleep after my morning walk and breakfast. <br><br>

I'm trying to work on a couple of things that I've planned to finish my the end of this year.<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>&#8226; Working on a board game. Check out the design log here at <a href="https://lonelynightproject.tumblr.com/">lonely night project.</a><br><br>
    </li>
    <li>&#8226; Always in mind but nothing in reality twine game, about self-amusement, which even now is only in mind but taking more active space than before. Trying to figuring out a basic conceptual flow then will start writing and keep a log on a git repo.<br><br></li>
    <li>&#8226; Another twine game on helplessness and getting trapped by your own actions, called No Way Out. <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>&#8226; Learning P5js, though not very regular, but trying to make at least one sketch every weekend. <br><br>
    </li>
    <li>&#8226; Looking for remote game design jobs. <br><br>
    </li>
</ul>


I will keep updating this page as my interest, projects, and life changes. <br><br>
