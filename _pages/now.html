<p>

I'm living in my hometown with parents, working on a couple of things, learning to play new games and new things about some really old ones. <br><br>

<ul>
    <li>&#x2022 Making a tabletop game about growing flowers. Design log at <a href="https://lonelynightproject.tumblr.com/">lonely night project.</a></li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Working on a commissioned project as a game researcher for a living games museum based on a personal collection of traditional games.</li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Exploring my old interest in toy making again. Hopefully some updates coming soon.</li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Learning <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5js</a>, not very regular, but trying to make at least one sketch every weekend. Also, in free time trying out some digital drawing techniques, see my <a href="https://bunbutterjam.tumblr.com/">visual blog.</a></li><br>
    <li>&#x2022 Reading <i>The Search - Talks on the Ten Bulls of Zen</i> by Osho. </li><br>
  </ul>
