    <b>Gameplay</b> <br><br>
    
    Every turn, players draw two movement card from the deck and can play one. As the players travel across the board, they collect different color hexes, and store it in the luggage box.As the players reach to a destination and finishes one of their station card, they keep a marker there revealing it to the other players. Players at the same station can exchange train information and can also decide to trade hexes if they wish. Different color hexes score different points and a combination or a set of hexes has extra points which are given on the reference sheet. 
    <br><br>
    
    As the players try to complete to get the perfect combination of hexes and reach to their destinations, at any point in the game, if any one player finishes all their destination cards and also fills both of the luggage with a complete set of any value, it triggers a game end. After the last round, all the players calculate their respective score and the player with the highest score wins the game, irrespective of the one who has ended it.
