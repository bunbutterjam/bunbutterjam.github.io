    Hi, I'm Swapnesh, I design games, gamification, playful interactions and do design research.<br><br>

    I work as an independent game designer and researcher, in varied capacity with studios, clients and in collaboration with
    other designers, artists,
    researchers, and developers. My current area of interest is in exploring games and play as a form of non-linguistic
    communication, to explore, express and learn complex and non-linear ideas/systems in an abstract and creative ways. My other interests are in the areas of Aesthetics of Play,
    Transformative Play, Learning and Games, Meaningful Gamification, Alternative Education, Play Learning Spaces, History and Culture of Games/Play, Generative Design and
    Design Education. <br><br>

    I enjoy listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music" target="_blank" >Hindustani Classical</a>,
    Folk, and Jazz music. I like reading children books, specially those written by children or without words, love flipping
    pages a lot. 
    I support coexistence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism" target="_blank">absurdism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_movement">free as in freedom</a> and <a
