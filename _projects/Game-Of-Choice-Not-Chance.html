<p>
    Game of Choice, not Chance, is a USAID-funded pilot program in India for urban and peri-urban adolescent girls
    between the age of 15-19 to provide sexual and reproductive health knowledge through a narrative based video game
    based on real life scenarios. In the game players chooses to play as a character which best represent their own
    physical, demographic and psychographic manifestations and make choices for the character. This allows players to be
    an active agent within the safe virtual environment, acquire knowledge, and negotiate on different topics with
    different non playing characters (NPCs) as they navigate through the characters journey, make choices and see the
    simulated outcomes of their choices.

    This is a multi organizational collaboration project between different agencies for research, design, art and tech.
    I worked as a Game Designer with <a href="https://www.vihara.asia/">Vihara Innovation Network</a>, a design
    consultancy studio, who lead the creative and design part of the project. My work involved designing tools for the
    research, planing and conducting field research with other researchers, ideation and brainstorming with the team,
    concept creation and contributing game design perspectives to the project.
