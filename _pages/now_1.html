 <b>Living</b>
  I finally can and have started to travel after being at home for a long time. This time, I'm travelling the way I always wanted to, staying at one place for a considerable amount of time, and then moving to the next place and so on. I left home two months back in July, I've been in Shillong, Meghalaya for sometime, and now I'm spending some time at by brother's place in BITS, Pilani. I usually like the campus life, but this time it is little different, weather is hot, canteen's are not open, and also I've not been exploring the outside town much. Most of the time I find myself sitting in front of my laptop watching country side videos on YT. In the coming weeks, I'm planning to go to Himachal for sometime. I'm preparing a toy making workshop for children at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/sambhaavnaa.org/clc2/">Udaan Learning Center</a> in Palampur. The workshop is for one week, but I might stay longer depend on if I get a chance to learn and explore other possibilities with the children and the community there. From Palampur, I'll be going to a place near a small village Gushaini near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Himalayan_National_Park">Himalayan National Park</a>. I'm hoping to stay there for sometime, though I'm little skeptical about the internet coverage at the place as I'll be continuing my work from there.

<b>Work</b>>


<ol type="1">
  <li>&#x2022 Working as a Game Design Consultant for an EdTech startup <a target="_blank"
    href="https://www.crejo.fun">Crejo.fun</a>, to create an online playful learning environment for extracurricular
    activities for children. <br>
    <i>Update:</i> The Gamification work is almost coming to an end, we have the strategies and constructs ready, some part of the UI is also done, I guess a part of it will roll out by the end of this month and a v0 with other features will be live in the coming weeks. Currently, I'm working with the curriculum team to design new learning games that would be specific to the course content and help children learn and practice the subjects.
  </li> 

  <li>I've working on two other projects as a Design Consultant, one with a Stealth Startup working in the area of mental health and holistic wellbeing. We are making a mobile app for young professionals that help them with their mental and emotional health by providing personalized courses, guided meditations, and needed support related to their specific problems. The other project is with <a href="https://www.lecodegames.com/home/">LECODE GAMES</a>, where I'm helping them with the overall design strategy, UX design and game design for different products they are developing.</li>

  <li>Working on my new tabletop game, inspired from the Indian ritual of offering flowers to the gods. This project started as a part of <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/tabletop-mentorship-program">The Tabletop Mentorship Program</a> with <a target="_blank" href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/8935/jeffrey-d-allers">Jeff</a> but as always I was hesitant to grow the design and haven't tested the game much hence very slow progress. The 9th iteration is up for playtesting on TTS that I last tested time with Jeff before sending it for the <a href="https://theboardgameworkshop.com"> Board Game Design Contest</a>, the game couldn't even across the round one <i>(as expected)</i>, but because of it, we somehow managed to make a short <a href="https://youtu.be/JKK5qhAoc8Y">video of the gameplay</a> and a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aY57ZWu3fpvyOpyE_AUpKWfnmyOK37GC/view?usp=sharing">sell sheet</a> for the game, this reminded me of my engineering days. <i></i>(less thinking, more making, hahaha)</i> The game received some constructive feedback and offers of help with playtesting by the judges. In my free time, I'm hoping to continue working on the game, and test it virtually with the some peers from the online community. I'd planned to keep a design log for this project at <a target="_blank" href="https://lonelynightproject.tumblr.com/">lonely night project.</a> but I've been a little lazy <i>(infact a lot)</i> in keeping up with the weekly progress. Hopefully I will soon document the iterations at least till now.
